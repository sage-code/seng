<h1>Programming Languages</h1>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">
A language once implemented can&rsquo;t be changed too much, or if you do you can loose your customers. So to make improvements you need to create a new language from scratch. Therefore today we have numerous computer languages competing for usability or performance.

<h4>Play List</h4>

<p>Short overview of 10 programming languages: {HTML, JavaScript, Python, Julia, Rust, Go, Swift, C#, Java, C++}. For each of these languages there is short video lecture of about 4 upt to 14 minutes for a total of 50 minutes.</p>

<h2><a id="classification"/>Language classification</h2>

<p>I have organized programming languages in 6 categories each containing top 5. This was a research project I have done in 2017 using Google+ surveys. I will try to update this top every year using Twitter since Google+ is gone now. Follow me and vote when I post articles about it. The link for twitter the little bird icon on bottom of this page.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><span style="color:brown">Disclaimer:&nbsp;</span>In next classification, the languages are ordered of our estimated technical value not in order of popularity.

<h2><a id="history"/>Historic Languages</a></h2>

<p>Languages that have more then 40 years are considered traditional. That is before the Internet was born. That was the golden age of classic computer languages: { Fortran, Lisp, Simula, Algol, Pascal, B, C, C++, Forth, Scheme, ML, Smalltalk. } Two of these languages remain very influential:&nbsp;<b>C</b>&nbsp;family and&nbsp;<b>Algol</b>&nbsp;family. Functional languages are derived from Lisp and Object oriented languages are derived from Simula.</p>

<p>Next computer languages are less then 40 years old. Let&rsquo;s review some of them. Maybe you will find a language that you can learn to create your next project with it. I will update this list from time to time with new languages I find worthy.</p>

<h2><a id="emerging"/>Emerging Languages</h2>

<p>These languages are not yet ready but promising. We are going to research these languages in our programming classes. If you wish you can learn these languages by yourself but only if you are not yet busy working for raising a family or having a busy life.</p>

<h2><a id="features"/>Language features</h2>

<p>To describe a computer language you can enumerate it&rsquo;s features. These are characteristics or attributes that can be compared. Some languages looks like each other and create a family. Here are the most significant features.</p>

<h2><a id="future"/>Future development</h2>

<div class="alert alert-secondary shadow-sm">Why are we creating so many new computer languages? I will try to clarify this subject. To do so, I have search YouTube for a relevant video about the <em>"future of programming languages"</em> and I have found one. It is all about learning from history.</div>

<p>There are many computer languages out there and takes a lifetime to learn them all. The languages with the strongest position in software industry are: Fortran, C, C++, Objective-C and Lisp. New computer languages are created because old computer languages can not be fixed.</p>
<p>Once a computer language was used in production it is needed unchanged for support. If is changing too much then it becomes a new computer language. This is what happen to Niklaus Wirth languages. They have evolved too fast: Pascal, Modula, Oberon. All genial, all forgotten.</p>
<p>For developers is very difficult to switch from one computer language to another. Every new computer language promises to correct previous issues from other languages. Some languages may have new paradigms that may be even harder to grasp.</p>

<h4>Bob Martin</h4>

<p>Next video is about 1h +20min. If you have the time, I highly recommend this speech about the future of programming languages. This video is very popular it has now 23k views. I have enjoyed watching, it is very informative and fun!</p>

<hr>

<div class="alert alert-danger"><span style="color:brown">Conclusion from this video:&nbsp;</span>Sooner or later programming languages will be ruled by politicians. We will have regulations surrounding programming activity and probable the government will approve one or other language for most critical applications.</div>


<h4>My opinion</h4>

<p>Programming languages should improve communication between humans. We write and read the code, not the computers. The computer should do whatever we tell him to do. It should be able to compile any kind of language. The strive is to make languages that are efficient to compile but also programmer friendly.</p>

<p>In the future, programmers will avoid regulations and will create disruptive new, open source programming languages. There will be always rogue programmers. Rogue languages will be learned quickly by smart individuals who need jobs and will become influential because they will work better. The government do not like to spend money on technology so they will chose open source languages that can't be regulated.</p>
